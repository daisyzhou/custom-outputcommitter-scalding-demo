This is a skeleton project for Kiji Express. see: www.kiji.org https://github.com/kijiproject/kiji-express

It contains a folder `src/main/ddl` which contains a .ddl file that creates a table.  Edit the .ddl
file to modify the table description. Sample table data is located in `src/main/resources/users.txt`.

Two scala files are used to import the sample data and to do a very basic read/write operation - copying
a string from one column to another.

If you're using the [BentoBox](http://www.kiji.org/getstarted/#configuring_your_environment), set up Bento and Kiji:

    bento start
    kiji install

To run the demo, build the jars:

    mvn package

Import sample data:

    kiji-schema-shell --file=src/main/ddl/table_desc.ddl
    express job target/scratch-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar org.kiji.scratch.DemoKijiLoader --table kiji://.env/default/users --input src/main/resources/users.txt

Run the table operation:

    express job target/scratch-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar org.kiji.scratch.DemoKiji --table kiji://.env/default/users

You can view the results using:

    kiji scan kiji://.env/default/users


If you've already run this example, you'll have to delete the users table first (don't do this
if you need to keep anything in your users table):

    kiji delete --target=kiji://.env/default/users
